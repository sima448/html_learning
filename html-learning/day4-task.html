        <h1> Pythagorean theorem </h1>
        <h2> A geometric harmony </h2>
        <p> The <strong><em>Pythagorean Theorem</em></strong> is a fundamental 
            principle in geometry ,it states that in a right-angled triangle,
        the square of the length of the <em>hypotenuse</em>(the side opposite the right angle)
    is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. 
mathematically, it can be expressed as: </p>
<div><strong>h<sup>2</sup> = p<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup></strong></div>
<p> Here , represents the length of the hypotenuse ,while a and  b are the 
    lengths of the other two sides.</p>
    <p> This theorem is named after the ancient greek mathematician<strong> 
        Pythagoras</strong>,who made significant countributions to the field of 
        mathematics
