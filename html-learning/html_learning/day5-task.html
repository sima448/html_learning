    <p>Welcome to my first<strong> Recipe Book </strong> project. Below you will find a
    few recipes gathered from different sources across the web. I highly enjoy
these delicious meals, and would like to share with the beautiful people 
of the internet (while simultaneously practicing my coding skills )-It's a win-win situation!
